Manhood is a templating engine and scripting language with a concise grammar. It is capable of performing a wide variety of generation tasks, including but not limited to the following:

* Generating HTML, JSON, and other recursive text-based data structures
* Writing randomly generated word, sentences, or even stories
* Creating strong passwords
* Generating character names and other attributes
* Applying filters to strings
* Random picking from uniform and weighted data sets
* Self-generating code
* An ass-ton more... it's limited by your imagination, honestly.

See the [wiki](http://github.com/TheBerkin/Manhood/wiki) for language and API documentation.
