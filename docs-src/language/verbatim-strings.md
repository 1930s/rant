**Verbatim strings** are strings that are printed exactly as they are typed. A verbatim string is written inside a pair of double quotes.

```rant
This is regular text
"This is a verbatim string"
```

One of the most immediately observable advantages of verbatim strings is that they can print whitespace, including line breaks, exactly how they are written in a pattern.

```rant
"This string
is separated
into multiple
lines, and
will be 
printed exactly
like this."
```
